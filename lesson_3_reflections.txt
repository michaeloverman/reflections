When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever I'm working on different computers, or in different locations. If I'm afraid of one computer crashing. To save space on my local storage device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Other contributers - too many to deal with. Use the online repository to accept or reject before downloading to local.
