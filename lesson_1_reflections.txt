Comparing files

USE CMD window, NOT PowerShell
fc compares the filse, shows each difference. Does NOT tell you where it is, with a line number for example. At least not that I can see.

spotted the mispelled word immediately, amongst a few lines, rather than 1000s

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
See the progression/thought process. Always go back and fix.
More willing to experiment with new ideas, knowing you won't destroy anything.
Have the learning process 'documented' in a way.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Cons
forget when "in the moment"
lose work if crash
Pros
changes are logical, easy to find later

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log to find what changed according to notes
diff to find specific changes within the files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
free to try things, knowing will always find a way back. It is the bread crumbs of a birdless world.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
learning to program - java and ruby, other stuff too, maybe javascript, etc.
