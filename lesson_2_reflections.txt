What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a .git file/folder is created, ready to accept a first commit. To set up the whole shebang.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I don't really know. The SA is just a 'status' for files in the wd. Good to have a step to consider what you're about to do before committing to the commit
