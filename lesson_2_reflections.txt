What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a .git file/folder is created, ready to accept a first commit. To set up the whole shebang.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I don't really know. The SA is just a 'status' for files in the wd. Good to have a step to consider what you're about to do before committing to the commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By placing each file changed, one at a time, into the staging area, after logical changes, you can keep track of what's been changed, and what hasn't. It also
provides an 'intermediary' step between working file and commit, allowing you to check on other changes.
Question: does placing a file in the staging area place the file AS IT IS at that moment, or just the file. In other words,
would changes after staging be included in the commit or not?
TEST: Staging now.
